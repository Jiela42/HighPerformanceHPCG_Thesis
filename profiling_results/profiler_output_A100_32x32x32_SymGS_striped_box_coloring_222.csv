Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too."

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too."

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Find the instruction producing the data being waited upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to shared memory.. This stall type represents about 49.1% of the total average of 22.5 cycles between issuing two instructions."

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too."

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 7.97 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.99 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too."

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to shared memory.. This stall type represents about 47.7% of the total average of 22.4 cycles between issuing two instructions."
